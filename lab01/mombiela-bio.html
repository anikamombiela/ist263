        My name is Anika Mombiela.
        I am an Information Management and Technology major at Syracuse University, and I am most interested in dedicating my future work life to Project Management.
        My accomplishments include:
        -	Getting into Syracuse University
        -	A good GPA in college
        -	Merit-based scholarship
        Some of my skills include:
        -	Excel certification
        -	Programming (Python)
        -	Project management skills
        My hobbies include:
        -	Reading
        -	Photography
        -	Spending quality time with family and friends
        My favorite movie is “Back to the Future” and my favorite TV show is “Stranger Things.”
        The best book I have read is “It Ends with Us.”
        My family and I are very close. We spend much of our time together and try to take advantage of that time as much as possible.
        I recently became interested in makeup and skincare. I like how it makes women around the world feel empowered and confident.
        Something unique about me is that I do not like any desserts that are not chocolate-based.

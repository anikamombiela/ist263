                <h2>Personal Information</h2>
                <p>
                My favorite movie is “Back to the Future” and my favorite TV show is “Stranger Things.”
                The best book I have read is “It Ends with Us.”
                My family and I are very close. We spend much of our time together and try to take advantage of that time as much as possible.
                I recently became interested in makeup and skincare. I like how it makes women around the world feel empowered and confident.
                Something unique about me is that I do not like any desserts that are not chocolate-based.

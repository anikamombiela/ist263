        <h2 class="center-text">Why is it important to have a routine tailored to you?</h2>

        <p class="center-text">
            Many factors play a part in choosing a specific makeup product for a specific person. Everyone has a different skin type, makeup style, and budget, so not every product is going to match someone's necessities. Some products are going to perform better on certain skin types. In addition, not all products are created equal. Some are for people who are looking to do a more professional makeup look, and others are more for everyday use. There are also price variations. Some products are more high-end, and some others are cheaper. That is why knowing where you stand on each of these categories is crucial to choosing the right products for you.

            <stong>Emilia:</stong>Makeup is something I use multiple times a day, and over time, I've noticed that my preferences and needs change. Whether it's because my skin tone shifts or certain textures no longer work for me, I'm constantly adjusting the products I use. This website sounds like a perfect solution to help me stay on top of those changes by providing personalized recommendations based on my skin type, makeup style, and budget. It would make my routine much more efficient, especially since, as a college student, going to stores to test products isn't always practical.

            <strong>Susana:</strong>As someone who wears makeup every day, I run out of products fairly fast, and I constantly need to buy restocks. I am a woman in my 40s, so the products I use must be very specific. I am always on the hunt for new products that might be better than the previous ones Iâ€™ve used. A website like Make It Up sounds perfect for finding better product recommendations according to my skin type.
